1. Here is your project.
You are to create a simple chat bot that accepts input from the user and gives a  response.
[1:00 PM, 12/12/2020] Tobi Akin: This is a template for what it's should look like when it's done.
[1:08 PM, 12/12/2020] Tobi Akin: Key things to note.
Your application should accept 
a. At least 4 different string inputs from the user.
- ....return them in a response.
Hint: string concatenation
b. At least 2 integers input from the user.
- do a mathematical operation on the integer and return the answer as output.
[1:11 PM, 12/12/2020] Tobi Akin: Deadline for both quiz 2 and project is Monday evening. 11:59 pm


2. [2:21 PM, 12/19/2020] Tobi Akin: Weekend task

a. Make a program in which the computer randomly chooses a number between 1 to 10, 1 to 100, or any range. Then give users a hint to guess the number. Every time the user guesses wrong, he gets another clue, and his score gets reduced. The clue can be multiples, divisible, greater or smaller, or a combination of all.

b. Dice Rolling Simulator.
You would be imitating a rolling dice.When the user rolls the dice, the program will generate a random number between 1 and 6 (as on a standard dice).
The number will then be displayed to the user. It will also ask users if they would like to roll the dice again.

c. Shuffle a sentence.
In this program, you'll shuffle a sentence (user inputs)
hints:using random module. And return a shuffled sentence.

For you guys


3. Tue: Project task
Your function would be given two strings a and b and your task will be to return the characters that are not common in the two strings.
For example:
solve("xyab","xzca") = "ybzc" 
--The first string has 'yb' which is not in the second string. 
--The second string has 'zc' which is not in the first string. 
Notice also that you return the characters from the first string concatenated with those from the second string.
Feel free to ask questions
Other test case
solve("xyabb","xzca"), output=>"ybbzc"
solve("abcd","xyz"), output=>"abcdxyz"
solve("xxx","xzca"), output=> "zca"
Submit before 9am tomorrow.
Good luck.


4. Today's task.
Write a function that return the number (count) of vowels in the given string.
We will consider a, e, i, o, u as vowels.
The input string will only consist of lower case letters and/or spaces.
